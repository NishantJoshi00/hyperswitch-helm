# Implement CD Pipeline Using Argo: Proposal

This proposal attemps to implement CD pipeline to automate the deployment process using Argo.

##  Folder Tree

- The proposed setup contains a `hyperstack-cd` folder at `charts/incubator` so as to achieve a proper structure and readiness.
- The tree layout would look like:

```text
.
├── charts/incubator
│   ├── hyperswitch-app
│   ├── hyperswitch-card-vault
│   ├── hyperswitch-cd
│   ├── hyperswitch-sdk
│   ├── hyperswitch-stack
|── repo 
```
