# Deploy on Kubernetes using Helm

This section outlines cloud-provider agnostic deployment steps for easy installation of the Hyperswitch stack on your K8s cluster

## Installation

### Step 1 - Clone repo and Update Configurations

Clone the [hyperswitch-stack](https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-helm) repo and start updating the configs

```
git clone https://github.com/juspay/hyperswitch-helm.git
cd hyperswitch-helm/charts/incubator/hyperswitch-stack
```

### Step 2 - Install Hyperswitch

Before installing the service make sure you labels your kubernetes nodes and create a namespace `hyperswitch`
```bash
kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> node-type=generic-compute
kubectl create namespace hyperswitch
```
Use below command to install hyperswitch services with above configs

```bash
helm install hyperswitch-v1 . -n hyperswitch
```

That's it! Hyperswitch should be up and running on your AWS account  :tada: :tada:

## Post-Deployment Checklist

After deploying the Helm chart, you should verify that everything is working correctly

### App Server

* [ ] &#x20;Check that `hyperswitch_server/health` returns `health is good`

### Control Center

* [ ] &#x20;Verify if you are able to sign in or sign up
* [ ] &#x20;Verify if you are able to [create API key](https://opensource.hyperswitch.io/run-hyperswitch-locally/account-setup/using-hyperswitch-control-center#user-content-create-an-api-key)
* [ ] &#x20;Verify if you are able to [configure a new payment processor](https://opensource.hyperswitch.io/run-hyperswitch-locally/account-setup/using-hyperswitch-control-center#add-a-payment-processor)

## Test a payment

### Step 1 - Deploy card vault

### Card Vault Installation

If you intend to save cards of your customers for future usage then you need a Card Vault. This helm chart doesn't cover inbuilt card vault support as it will violate PCI compliance. You can install manually by following the steps [here](https://opensource.hyperswitch.io/going-live/pci-compliance/card-vault-installation) or use [this doc to deploy card vault in aws](https://opensource.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/deploy-hyperswitch-on-aws/deploy-card-vault)

### Step 2 - Make a payment using our Demo App

Use the Hyperswitch Demo app and [make a payment with test card](https://opensource.hyperswitch.io/hyperswitch-open-source/test-a-payment).
